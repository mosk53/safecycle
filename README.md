# Bike Theft Check App

This is a Python project using KivyMD that helps users to check if a bike has been reported as stolen. 
Users can input the bike's frame number (also known as a "chassis number" or "VIN") 
and the app will search through a database of reported stolen bikes to see if the input number matches any records.

Please note that this app is still under development and there are currently no screenshots available.

## Installation

## Usage
